termsOfOverallGamingPerformance = In terms of overall gaming performance, the
littleBitBetter = is a little bit better than the
massivelyBetter = is a massively better than the 
whenItComesToRunningGames = when it comes to running games. This also means it will be less likely to bottleneck more powerful GPUs, allowing them to achieve more of their gaming performance potential.
bothCpusPerformance = Both CPUs exhibit nearly the same performance, so it probably isn't worth upgrading from one to the other
has = has
moreCoresThanThe = more cores than the
With = With
cores = cores
lessLikelyToBottleneck = is much less likely to struggle with the latest games, or bottleneck high-end graphics cards when running them.
Both = Both
and = and
useHyperthreading = use hyperthreading.
Only = only
noHyperthreading = None of these cpus uses hyperthreading.
multithreadingExplenation = Multiple threads are useful for improving the performance of multi-threaded applications. Additional cores and their accompanying thread will always be	beneficial for multi-threaded applications. Hyperthreading will be beneficial for applications optimized for it, but it may slow others down. For games, the number of threads is largely irrelevant, as long as you have at least 2 cores (preferably 4), and hyperthreading can sometimes even hit performance.
clockRateExplenation = More important for gaming than the number of cores and threads is the clock rate. Problematically, unless the two CPUs are from the same architecture, this can only serve as a general guide and nothing like an exact comparison, because the clock cycles per instruction (CPI) will vary so much.
areSameArch = are from the same architectures of CPUs
directlyComparable = and thus their clock speeds are directly comparable. With this in mind, it is safe to say that with a
fasterBaseClockRate = faster base clock rate,
managesProvideBetterPerformance =  manages to provide slightly better performance than the
sameCpuSpeed = have the same cpu speed, so this part cannot distinguish them
noSameArchitecture = are not from the same architecture of CPUs, so their clock speeds are by no means directly comparable.	
cacheExplanation = Aside from the clock rate, the next-most important CPU features for PC game performance are L2 and L3 cache size. Faster than RAM, the more cache available, the more data that can be stored for lightning-fast retrieval. L1 Cache is not usually an issue anymore for gaming, with most high-end CPUs eking out about the same L1 performance, and L2 is more important than L3 - but L3 is still important if you want to reach the highest levels of performance. Bear in mind that although it is better to have a larger cache, the larger it is, the higher the latency, so a balance has to be struck.
biggerL2Cache = bigger L2 cache than the
whichMeans = which means that it, at worst, wins out in this area, and at best, will provide superior gaming performance and will work much better with high-end graphics cards.

This process is called texture mapping.
